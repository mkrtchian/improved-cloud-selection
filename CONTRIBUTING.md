# Contributing

Thank you for considering to contribute to this project. There are many ways you can contribute, including features or bug fixes through pull requests, but also documentation improvement, opening issues for bugfixes or proposing feature requests.

If you would like to contribute please be kind and respectful.

## Feature requests and bug reports

Before creating an issue, please search in the existing issues if something similar doesn't already exist.

In case of bug report, providing detailed instructions to reproduce can really help fixing the bug quickly.

## Code contribution

All the code contributions are made through pull requests, to have discussion and code reviews, but also to let the CI validate that everything works.

As much as possible please consider submitting your ideas or your work early to get feedback, instead of working very long on something that may not be integrated.

### Code quality

The code has to maintain a good level of quality. It has to remain readable, correctly formatted and tested (if possible written with test driven development). The styling is written in a mobile-first way, to it has to remain responsive. It should also be accessible as much as possible to include everyone.

To begin your code contribution, please follow the [instructions for local environment installation](docs/local.md). You will find there how to run every code quality tool that will be also run in the CI.
